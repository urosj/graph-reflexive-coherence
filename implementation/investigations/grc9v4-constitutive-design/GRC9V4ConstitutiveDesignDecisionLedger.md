# GRC9V4 Constitutive Design Decision Ledger

**Status:** Initialized; no gate decision accepted

This ledger is the additive decision record for D0-D10. The design basis and
plan define questions and constraints; this file records accepted answers.
Rejected alternatives remain visible rather than being rewritten after a later
selection.

## Ledger Rules

Every gate record must contain:

```text
gate_id
status
predecessor_decision_digest
decision_record_digest
supersedes
source_identities
assumptions
candidates_considered
decision
rejected_alternatives
evidence_or_argument
open_debt
blocked_relabels
authorization_effect
human_acceptance
```

An unresolved field is written as `pending` or `not_identifiable`, never filled
from anticipated later results. Design arguments, analytical prototypes, and
runtime evidence keep distinct provenance labels.

Accepted records are immutable and append-only. Reopening a gate creates a new
record with `predecessor_decision_digest` and `supersedes`; it does not edit the
accepted payload. The canonical decision payload is the complete gate record
with `decision_record_digest` omitted, serialized as UTF-8 JSON with object keys
sorted lexicographically, compact `,` and `:` separators, ASCII escaping
enabled, and array order preserved. `decision_record_digest` is the SHA-256 of
those canonical bytes. A prose-only record cannot receive an accepted digest
unless an equivalent structured decision object is frozen with it.

`predecessor_decision_digest` names the accepted serial predecessor gate.
`supersedes` names an earlier record of the same gate when that gate is reopened.
For example, `D3-v2` consumes the accepted D2 digest as predecessor and names
the D3-v1 digest under `supersedes`.

Every debt carried by `accepted_bounded` must contain:

```text
debt_id
blocking_scope
candidate_scope
assumption_forbidden_downstream
resolution_gate
must_close_before_D10
```

`rejected_all_candidates`, `blocked_missing_theory`, or
`blocked_missing_discriminator` may open only a bounded D10 closeout route or a
named revised gate. They do not authorize later constitutive gates.
`rejected_all_candidates` is recorded as `current_candidate_set_exhausted`; it
does not reject the GRC9V4 target and must identify a named next derivation,
candidate-admission revision, or discriminator requirement.

## Initialization Record

Authoritative structured record:
[`GRC9V4ConstitutiveDesignInitialization.json`](./GRC9V4ConstitutiveDesignInitialization.json)

The following is a non-authoritative reading summary; the JSON record and its
verified semantic digest define the predecessor identity.

```text
